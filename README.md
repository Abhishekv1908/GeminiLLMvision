Here's a README for your GitHub project that explains how to set up and run the Streamlit app without using an `.env` file. I'll assume the user will manually input the API key.

# Gemini Image Demo by Abhishek

This is a simple Streamlit web application that utilizes the **Google Gemini Generative AI** model to analyze and provide responses based on the provided text prompt and image.

## 🛠️ Features
- Upload an image (PNG, JPG, JPEG).
- Enter a text prompt to accompany the image.
- Generate descriptive responses about the uploaded image using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- Pillow
- Google Generative AI SDK (`google-generativeai`)

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-image-demo.git
   cd gemini-image-demo
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the API Key:**

   Instead of using an `.env` file, manually set your Google API key in the script:

   ```python
   import google.generativeai as genai
   genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY")
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"` with your actual API key.

## 📊 Running the App

```bash
streamlit run vision.py
```

This will start a local server. Open the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser to interact with the app.

---

## 💡 Usage

1. Upload an image using the file uploader.
2. Enter a text prompt (optional).
3. Click the **"Tell me about the image"** button.
4. The app will display a response generated by the Gemini model.
