## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-image-demo.git
   cd gemini-image-demo
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the API Key:**

   ```python
   import google.generativeai as genai
   genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY")
